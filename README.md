-             Coursework   Release   Date –   12/02/2025 at   15:00
-             Please submit your assignment    on-line via Moodle by the official date and    time   deadline. The submission link will be available along with the coursework in the same tab as the Module. 
-             The   assignment   is   a   case study   exercise   (consisting   of   research   and   design). Credit   will   be   given   for   appropriate   design   choices,   backed up by relevant   calculations,   justification of assumptions      and appropriate      references to existing wind turbine   designs, research papers, etc   . (see specifications   below).
Instructions for the Wind Turbine Design assignment Coursework – Present the outline design for a new wind power generation system (wind turbine, generation, and MPPT controls) for Cloud Computing Site in your home city (i.e., birthplace). The power of the system required would be 6MW for students roll numbers ending    in 0/3/6,    10MW for students    roll    numbers ending    in    1/4/7 and 16MW for students roll numbers ending in 2/5/8/9. Odd roll numbers will have high speed generator and even roll numbers will have direct drive generator. 
Key points to address in the poster while providing outline design. 
0.      Consider   the   design   exercise   (coursework)   for   horizontal   axis wind   turbine   (you   can   ignore   vertical   axis   wind   turbines   for   this   activity).
1.      Clearly   indicate   the   specifications   based   on   the   roll   number   ending   digit,   birthplace   and odd/even roll   number.
2.      Justify   why   wind   is   preferable   and what   are   potential   other   options   (again justify   the   choices) (options - single renewable, hybrid, or storage   based   a   better option).
3.       Determine the historic wind data associated with your location   and   provide   a   plot of   it.
4.      Select a capacity factor and   justify your choice.
5.       Determine the total installed capacity   required based on your choices   .
6.      The   option   of   using   either   one   full   capacity   wind   turbine   or   multiple   smaller   wind   turbines    (can    all      be    same      power      rating      or      di代 写EEEE3019 Renewable Energy Technologies – 24-25Matlab
代做程序编程语言fferent      power      rating).      Justify      your selection   and   if   you   go   for   multiple   smaller   turbines   then justify   the   selected   number   of smaller wind turbines and their respective power   rating.
7.       Draw   a   one-line   electrical   diagram   from   an   employed   electrical   system   for   the   wind   power   generation   (starting   from   source   to   sink).
8.       Explain the outline design of wind turbine.
a.      Choice of rated wind speed, tip speed ratio, blade diameter and   blade   speed
9.       Explain the outline design of electrical generator. 
a.      Selection   of   generator   type,   pole    number,   drive   type,   gearbox    ratio,   outer diameter,   and    stack    length    (active    magnetic    length    of    electrical    generator   core) 
10. Selection of the turbine control strategy. Discuss   MPPT in two to three sentences   .
11. Pick   a   current   product   (wind   turbine)   that   is   available   on   the   market   closest   to   the   generated design values   in point 6.
12. Put   relevant   references    (expected    5    minimum   and    can   be    more   –    please    do   not   provide google and Wikipedia references)
13. Make good use of visuals to   make your   work exciting from its   looks   .
Justify any assumptions made as it carries marking weightage. 
Note: Only one submission in the pdf form will be allowed. Anything which is not a poster or beyond the poster will not be considered for assessment. 
Editing and formatting information/clarification Please note that there is   no word limit, only size   limit – one-page   poster   (see the template for   more   information).   Figure   and   table   should   have   their   own   captions,   numbering,   and   short   explanation.   No   appendix   needed.   Have   a   balance   between   text   and   visuals   .   Feel   free   to   use    flowcharts, smart art, block      diagrams,      etc   .      to create an exciting      poster. Select   contrasting color combinations (avoid use of similar colors    –    e.g.    yellow    text    on    white   background).   All   the   topics   and   sections   should   have   connectivity   (should   tell   one   single   story)   –   not   like five/six   different   topics   stitched   together.   Use   1.1   line   spacing   as   minimum,   and minimum of   18pt font. Margins as shown in the template.   Use “sans serif” style. font.
